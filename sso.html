Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Configure Laravel as a SAML SP:</li></ol><p>To configure your Laravel application as a SAML SP, you can use a SAML SP library like <code>aacotroneo/laravel-saml2</code>. This library provides a simple way to enable SAML SSO in your Laravel application.</p><ol start="2"><li>Configure Okta as an IdP:</li></ol><p>You need to create an Okta account if you don't have one already. Then you need to configure Okta as an IdP by creating an Okta application in the Okta admin console. You need to provide the SAML metadata of your Laravel application to Okta, which can be obtained from the SAML SP library you are using.</p><ol start="3"><li>Exchange metadata:</li></ol><p>You need to exchange metadata between the SAML SP library and Okta to establish a trust relationship. You need to provide the metadata of your Laravel application to the vendor, and the vendor needs to provide the metadata of their application to you.</p><ol start="4"><li>Configure vendor's application:</li></ol><p>The vendor needs to configure their application to use Okta as an IdP and provide the SSO link to your Laravel application.</p><ol start="5"><li>Test SSO:</li></ol><p>Once everything is configured, you need to test SSO to ensure it is working as expected. You can use the SSO link provided by the vendor to test SSO.</p><p>By following these steps, you can enable SSO between your Laravel application and the vendor's application using SAML and Okta as the IdP.</p></div></div>
